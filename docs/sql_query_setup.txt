############################# SQL QUERY FILE SET UP #############################

This file defines the structure of the 'properties/sql_query.json' file.

The 'properties/sql_query.json' file contains the queries to run on the
database in the form of 'identifier': 'query'.

The queries are built dynamically by a query builder based on
a 'query_id' variable specific for every method.

Be careful to use the same 'identifier' as those provided in the
'sample/sql_query.json' file, otherwise the query builder cannot build queries.

The 'properties/sql_query.json' file defines:

    - mobile_sensor_ids: query for getting mobile sensor ids


Please, see 'sample/sql_query.json' for practical examples.
